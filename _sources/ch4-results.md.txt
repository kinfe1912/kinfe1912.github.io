* Image will render line by line as UART is slow
* As the memory resources of the selected device are scarce with respect to the image storage requirment, a amximu resolution of 320x240 can be used. However, the display supports a minimum resolution of 640x480. So the image used in the test is displayed on the top left corner of the monitor.
